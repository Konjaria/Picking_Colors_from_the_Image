# Picking_Colors_from_the_Image
Some Drawings in Python

<body>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>This code uses the colorgram and turtle packages to extract the most dominant colors from an image and display the colors in a grid pattern using the turtle graphics module.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <br>
  <p>To run the code, make sure you have the colorgram and turtle packages installed. You also need to replace "My_Image.jpg" with the name of the image file you want to use. The number of iterations, which determines the number of colors extracted, can be changed by modifying the number_of_iteration variable.</p>

  <h2>Output</h2>
  <p>The code also outputs a list of RGB values for the dominant colors in the image in the console.</p>
  <p>The code outputs a display window with a grid of dots, each dot representing a randomly selected color from the list of dominant colors extracted from the image. The size and position of the dots can be adjusted by modifying the code.</p>

  <h3><em>Conclusion</em></h2>
  <p><em>This code provides a basic demonstration of how to extract colors from an image and display the colors using turtle graphics.</em></p>
